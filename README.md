# Zenjoy-angular

This is a remake of the Starbucks landing page of rewards (https://www.frontendpractice.com/project/starbucks)

To run this project you need to have node installed (minimum version: v12.20)

First time:
1. Open a command prompt or VSCode with a terminal
2. Make sure you are in the "starbucks-angular" directory
3. Enter: "npm install" (this may take up to a few minutes)
4. Enter: "ng serve -o"

Now localhost:4200 should open
(if you get errors, try updating node to the latest version)
